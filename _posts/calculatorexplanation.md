To make a calculator, you first need to make the number buttons.
Then, you have to use onclick and then use a function you made. 
For example, for the AC button, I made a function called reset and basically just reseted the variable.
I also used a calculate function and used eval, which just calculates evrything for you. 
And I made a function called hello which just puts the numbers into the textbox.
This concludes my post.
