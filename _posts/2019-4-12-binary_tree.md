### Binary Tree
Binary Trees are when each node in a tree has two or less child nodes.
The top node is the root.
The bottom node is the leaf.
### Binary Search Tree
In a Binary Search Tree, on any subtree, the left nodes are all less than the right nodes. 
This makes finding a node very easy.
### Transverse
You can transverse through a tree like this. 
You take the number you are looking for, and then if it is bigger or lower for the next node.
If it is bigger, than you go left.
If it is smaller, than you go right. 
This goes on until you find your numebr.
For Example, to find 12 on the binary tree, you go left (smaller), left again (smaller), and then right (bigger), to get 12.
