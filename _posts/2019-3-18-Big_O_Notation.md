title: Big O Notation
---
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes how long an algorithim takes. 

I did some research, and I found out that the best O notations are O(log n) and O(1) are the best types. 
They either are a straight line at 1,(O(1)) or increases very slowly, which is in fact just means that it is a very fast way. 
The worst are O(n!), O(2^n), and O(n^2)
All of these increase very fast, which means the function itself is very slow.

That concludes my short post about Big O notation.
