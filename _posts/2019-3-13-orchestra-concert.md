### Concert
Today I had an Orchestra Concert
I got first chair as cello!
(Not that impressive cuz there's only 3 cellos :( )
But anyway, I think I did pretty good
To me, the songs were kind of simple.
Last concert, My cello string broke, I got a cello with a not working endpin, and I forgot my shoes, so you can see why I would be nervous about this concert.
