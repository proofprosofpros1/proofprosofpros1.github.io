### The very long day

On Sunday here is what happened:
1. I went to coding club
2. I went to a SYSO concert
3. I cough the whole time at the concert
4. I went to AWANA
5. After Awana, I don't feel so good, so I went to my house, change clothes, and than go to the hospital!
6. I waited 40-55 minutes
7. After I get in, all the hospital things start happening, and I eventually get an IV.
8. Then, I get to ride in an ambulance.
9. Then, I go to another hospital, but this time in the Emergency room.
10. After an hour or two at the other hospital, I finally go home at about 12 o clock.
